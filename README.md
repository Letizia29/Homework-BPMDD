Analysis of dopamine lateralization function in relation to Parkinson's symptoms

The repository contains the MATLAB code HOMEWORK_Corso_Dattoli_Rossato.m to implement the analysis on the PPMI dataset, the MATLAB code dataset_saving_for_R.m that creates the datasets necessary for the R code, which is the file missing_values_analysis.R.

For the R code it's necessary to install the VIM package. 

The main MATLAB code saves the relevant figures in the same folder.
